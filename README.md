## Branching strategy
For each project I will not be following any specific branching strategy, but rather push straight to the main branch if I am satisfied with the work I have done. However, this may change should it become evident that it would beneficial for me to adopt a strategy in which case I will state what strategy I used and for which project I used the strategy.
## The use of .gitignore
In every project I will use .gitignore for any files that I may believe to to be unnecessary. Such files may include back up files or credentials. 
## Storing of sensitive information
Credentials and any other sensitice information will be added to gitignore that they may remain unexposed.
