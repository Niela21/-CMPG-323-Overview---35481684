## Branching strategy
The branching strategy I will be following for each project is Trunc Based Development. This basically means that I will not be making use of any branches, but rather push straight into the main branch once I am satisfied with my work.
## The use of .gitignore
In every project I will use .gitignore for any files that I may believe to to be unnecessary. Such files may include back up files or credentials. 
## Storing of sensitive information
Credentials and any other sensitice information will be added to gitignore that they may remain unexposed.
